Revision history for mod_cidr_lookup

1.2  2008-09-16
  * added hook point "ap_hook_post_read_request". because mod_cidr_lookup
    and SetEnvIf work fine together in server or virtual host context.

1.1  2008-09-12
  * move ap_hook point from fixups to header_parser. because mod_cidr_lookup
    must be performed before mod_setenvif if you refer environment variable
    with SetEnvIf directive.
    thanks for bug reporting: es-san

1.0  2008-08-01
